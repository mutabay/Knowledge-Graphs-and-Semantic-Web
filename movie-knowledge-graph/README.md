What is a Knowledge Graph?
Think of it as a smart network of connected facts:

Nodes = Entities (Movies, Actors, Users)
Edges = Relationships (acted_in, directed, rated)
Properties = Attributes (name, year, rating)

RDF Triple Structure
Every fact is a Subject-Predicate-Object triple:

<Tom_Hanks> <acted_in> <Forrest_Gump>
<Forrest_Gump> <has_genre> <Drama>
<User123> <rated> <Forrest_Gump>


# 🎬 Movie Knowledge Graph Project

A comprehensive implementation demonstrating **Knowledge Graph construction** using both **RDF/SPARQL** and **Neo4j/Cypher** approaches. This project showcases how to transform tabular movie data into rich, interconnected knowledge representations suitable for advanced analytics and recommendations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was built as a **learning journey** to understand:

### **What We Built:**
- **RDF Knowledge Graph**: Semantic web standards using RDF triples and SPARQL queries
- **Neo4j Property Graph**: Intuitive graph database with Cypher query language  
- **Comparative Analytics**: Side-by-side analysis of both approaches
- **Data Pipeline**: Complete ETL process from CSV to knowledge graphs
- **Query Examples**: Comprehensive collection of graph queries

### **Why Knowledge Graphs?**
Traditional databases store data in tables. Knowledge graphs store **relationships** and **context**:
Traditional: Movie table + Director table + Genre table
Knowledge Graph: (Movie)-[DIRECTED_BY]->(Director)-[WORKED_IN]->(Genre)


This enables:
- **Semantic Understanding**: What does the data *mean*?
- **Complex Relationships**: Multi-hop queries across entities
- **Reasoning**: Infer new knowledge from existing facts
- **Recommendations**: Find patterns and similarities

📊 Sample Data
The project includes movie data with the following structure:

movie_id,title,year,genres,director,rating
1,The Matrix,1999,Action|Sci-Fi,Lana Wachowski,8.7
2,Inception,2010,Action|Sci-Fi|Thriller,Christopher Nolan,8.8
3,Interstellar,2014,Drama|Sci-Fi,Christopher Nolan,8.6


Entities Created:
Movies: 7 films with titles, years, ratings
Directors: 6 unique directors
Genres: 6 different genres
Relationships: 20+ connections between entities

🔍 Query Examples
SPARQL (RDF) Example:

PREFIX movie: <http://movie-kg.org/ontology#>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?title ?year ?rating
WHERE {
    ?movie a movie:Movie .
    ?movie movie:hasTitle ?title .
    ?movie movie:releasedIn ?year .
    ?movie movie:hasRating ?rating .
    ?movie movie:directedBy ?director .
    ?director foaf:name "Christopher Nolan" .
}
ORDER BY ?year

Cypher (Neo4j) Example:
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:DIRECTED_BY]->(d:Director {name: 'Christopher Nolan'})
RETURN m.title as title, m.year as year, m.rating as rating
ORDER BY m.year

Both queries find Christopher Nolan's movies, but notice:

SPARQL: More verbose, standards-based, great for semantic reasoning
Cypher: More intuitive, ASCII art syntax, great for graph traversal

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Neo4j Connection Failed:
# Check if Neo4j is running
docker ps | grep neo4j

# Check logs
docker logs movie-neo4j

Memory Issues with Large Datasets:

# In neo4j_loader.py, use batch processing:
def load_in_batches(self, df, batch_size=100):
    for i in range(0, len(df), batch_size):
        batch = df[i:i+batch_size]
        # Process batch


SPARQL Query Timeouts:
# In rdf_builder.py, optimize queries:
# Add LIMIT clauses for large datasets
query += " LIMIT 1000"

# **Knowledge Graphs - Technical Explanation (Simple)**

## **What is a Knowledge Graph?**
Instead of storing data in separate tables, a knowledge graph stores **relationships** between things.

**Traditional Database:**
```
Movies Table: [ID, Title, Year]
Directors Table: [ID, Name]
```

**Knowledge Graph:**
```
(Movie: "Inception") --[DIRECTED_BY]--> (Director: "Christopher Nolan")
(Movie: "Inception") --[HAS_GENRE]--> (Genre: "Sci-Fi")
```

---

## **Two Main Approaches We Built:**

### **1. RDF (Resource Description Framework)**
- **Format**: Everything is a **triple** (Subject-Predicate-Object)
- **Example**: `<Inception> <directedBy> <ChristopherNolan>`
- **Query Language**: SPARQL
- **Good for**: Semantic web, standards compliance, reasoning

### **2. Neo4j Property Graph**
- **Format**: Nodes with properties, connected by relationships
- **Example**: `(Movie {title: "Inception"})-[:DIRECTED_BY]->(Director {name: "Nolan"})`
- **Query Language**: Cypher
- **Good for**: Intuitive queries, performance, analytics

---

## **Key Technical Concepts:**

### **RDF Concepts:**
- **URI/Namespace**: `http://movie-kg.org/ontology#` - unique identifier space
- **Triple**: Every fact is Subject-Predicate-Object
- **Ontology**: Defines what types of things exist and how they relate
- **SPARQL**: Pattern matching query language

### **Neo4j Concepts:**
- **Node**: An entity (Movie, Director)
- **Relationship**: Connection between nodes
- **Label**: Type of node (`:Movie`, `:Director`)
- **Property**: Attributes stored on nodes/relationships
- **Cypher**: Visual ASCII-art query language

---

## **What Our Project Does:**

### **Pipeline Steps:**
1. **Load CSV data** (movies, directors, genres, ratings)
2. **Transform into RDF triples** - semantic representation
3. **Load into Neo4j** - property graph representation
4. **Run analytics** comparing both approaches
5. **Generate insights** and recommendations

### **Key Files:**
- `rdf_builder.py`: Converts CSV → RDF triples
- `neo4j_loader.py`: Converts CSV → Property graph
- `analytics.py`: Compares query results from both
- `pipeline.py`: Orchestrates everything

---

## **Query Comparison:**

### **Same Question, Different Languages:**

**SPARQL (RDF):**
```sparql
SELECT ?title WHERE {
  ?movie movie:hasTitle ?title .
  ?movie movie:directedBy ?director .
  ?director foaf:name "Christopher Nolan" .
}
```

**Cypher (Neo4j):**
```cypher
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:DIRECTED_BY]->(d:Director {name: "Christopher Nolan"})
RETURN m.title
```

Both find "movies directed by Christopher Nolan" but use different syntax.

---

## **Why Knowledge Graphs Matter:**

### **Traditional Problems:**
- Data in silos (separate tables)
- Complex joins for relationships
- Hard to find indirect connections

### **Knowledge Graph Solutions:**
- **Connected data**: Everything linked
- **Easy traversal**: Follow relationships naturally  
- **Pattern discovery**: Find hidden connections
- **Recommendations**: "Movies like this one"
- **Reasoning**: Infer new knowledge

---

## **Real-World Applications:**

### **What We Built (Simple):**
- Movie recommendations based on shared genres
- Director collaboration networks
- Genre co-occurrence analysis

### **Enterprise Examples:**
- **Google**: Search results with knowledge panels
- **Amazon**: Product recommendations
- **LinkedIn**: "People you may know"
- **Netflix**: Content recommendation engine

---

## **When to Use Each:**

### **Use RDF/SPARQL When:**
- Need semantic standards compliance
- Building for the semantic web
- Complex reasoning requirements
- Integration with external linked data

### **Use Neo4j/Cypher When:**
- Need high performance graph queries
- Intuitive query language preferred
- Real-time recommendations
- Graph analytics and algorithms

---

## **Technical Architecture:**

```

**Bottom Line**: We built the same knowledge representation in two different ways to compare their strengths and learn both approaches to graph databases.
