What is a Knowledge Graph?
Think of it as a smart network of connected facts:

Nodes = Entities (Movies, Actors, Users)
Edges = Relationships (acted_in, directed, rated)
Properties = Attributes (name, year, rating)

RDF Triple Structure
Every fact is a Subject-Predicate-Object triple:

<Tom_Hanks> <acted_in> <Forrest_Gump>
<Forrest_Gump> <has_genre> <Drama>
<User123> <rated> <Forrest_Gump>
